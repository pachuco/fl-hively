Done:
-Precalculated waveform generator
-Player works
-Compact Tracks[][] into single array and use offset multiplication instead of array nesting
-Turn everything that is public into internal and make a front_panel class
-Clean up warnings
-try VU meters

Todo:
-Get license.txt
-Synchro class(animation can be synchronised to music events)
-Optimisation. Currently, complex hvl tunes can get up to 20% CPU usage on a P4 630 @ 3ghz(disregard that, debug player is heavy)
-Regarding above, steal blep synthesis from kode54's foo_hively.
-Maybe tear the hvl mixer apart and use SoundChannels in hopes that it will take load off CPU? I dunno(don't actually).
-Rewrite wavegen functions to work directly with the vector.
-Clean up test player because it's a bloody and horifying mess.


Considered optimisations:
-tidy up the code, repackage and rename the classes/functions
-have panning changable on the fly
