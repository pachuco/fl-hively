Done:
-Precalculated waveform generator

Todo:
-Everything else
-Get license.txt
-Synchro class(animation can be synchronised to music events)
-Optimisation

Considered optimisations:
-compact nested arrays into single one and use offset multiplication instead of array index



// Class quickmap; struct pointer handling decisions go here
//
// Suggested way would be declaring vectors with the pointed structures in hvl_tune and turning
//the pointers themselves into uint offsets.
// Without memory pre-allocation, we push() stuff into the vectors.
